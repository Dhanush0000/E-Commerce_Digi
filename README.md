This version keeps the spirit of the original "DigitalHippo" README while aligning with your project name (`E-Commerce_Digi`) and repository (`Dhanush0000/E-Commerce_Digi`). I assumed a placeholder image path (`preview.jpg`)—feel free to adjust it to your actual image location. Let me know if you'd like further tweaks!
